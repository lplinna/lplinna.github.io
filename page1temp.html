  <h2>I've learned some things over the years.</h4>
  <p>It all started back in 2015 with the release of Undertale, my favorite video game ever. I felt awakened by the great story, the abstract gameplay, and the inspiring tale of one guy making a whole video game - including all of the music - with the help of his artist friends.&nbsp; I had to find people to talk to about it - and that led me to Discord. Little did I know that Discord was my gateway to many lasting friendships and real programming skills. 
    From it I've learned LUA, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C#.</p>

      <h1>UNITALE</h1>
      <p>The first programming language I learned was LUA, the main language of UNITALE, a Unity-based engine for making Undertale-themed battles. There I learned how to program waves, make objects wobble, rotate, and stab smoothly, and make loose attempts at storytelling.</p>

      <h1>Trick or Treat</h1>
      <p>This was my first gamejam project, created in a single weekend on the Unreal engine with two other people. Trick or Treat is your standard spooky game where a monster pursues you through darkened woods, as you collect pumpkins on the ground. </p>

      <h1>Cave Hero</h1>
      <p>Cave Hero is the first project I've participated in specifically for a game design class. Follow a stranded adventurer as they mine rocks, buy upgrades and discover a shocking secret about the king of the slime people! This project is of considerably higher polish than the others, and I had a great time programming the motions for the enemies, fire effects, and attack animations.</p>

      <h1>Zoomstick</h1>
      <p>Zoomstick is the second video game I've made with a team. In Zoomstick, you play as temple robber who finds an ancient shotgun capable of propelling the user high into the air. In this game, I wrote interpretive code used in loading/unloading levels.</p>

      <h1>All Ball</h1>
      <p>All Ball is an irreverent and difficult physics-based platformer, made by me and one other partner as a final project for a class. The main takeaway from this project is that the entire physics engine was programmed my partner and I, which was daunting but satisfying once it started to work!</p>
