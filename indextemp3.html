        Well, it's easiest to answer that question with where I live first. I come from Green Bay, Wisconsin, where my
        parents live in the middle of a large and somewhat boring suburb. With anything notable being a thirty-minute walk
        in any direction, it's easy to see why I preferred staying inside and gaming over having adventures in the open.
  
        <br><br>My dad is a programmer for the local school district, and he's part of the reason that I got into gaming. I love
        playing video games with him or sharing the latest and greatest game to get me excited.
  
        <br><br>My mom has both impaired vision and hearing, to the level that she needs a cane to navigate outside and hearing
        aids to listen to conversations. Through her, I learned that no matter what problems you may have you can still
        live a powerful and fulfilling life.
  
  
        <br><br>In high school, I met friends who had very different existences than mine. I learned quickly that my life was one
        of comfort and privilege; I got along with everyone in my family, we rarely had financial concerns, and safety was
        everything but guaranteed. For many, that's not always the case.
  
        <br><br>You know the drill: at my age, I'll take any job I can get. But I'd much rather make something inspiring,
        something that might help a bad day become a little better for someone out there. And quite often, the most
        effective way to do this is a nice, cathartic video game that pulls you in, develops your emotions, and spits you
        out into the real world again.

        Currently I'm attending University of Wisconsin - Stout for a B.S in Computer Science with an emphasis in game
        design. I aspire to be a part of the game design industry, producing emotional and fun experiences that people will
        love.
