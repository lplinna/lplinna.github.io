          changed my understanding of the genre it belongs in, or the genre it created. I believe they all deserve more

            <strong>UNDERTALE</strong>
          </h4>
          <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">UNDERTALE is a video game that swept the Internet in early 2015,
            advertising itself as 'The RPG where nobody has to die.' One of the most heart-moving games I have ever
            played, UNDERTALE puts you in the shoes of a child who falls into an underground
            continent inhabited by magical monsters. In each encounter you are given a means to pacify your assilant
            along with the means to attack and mortally wound your foes. That means, with every encounter, YOU must make
            the choice based on your own convictions.
            <br><br>UNDERTALE is the video game that inspired me to pursue game design and develop my programming
            skills. It's a game that is core to me and who I am. I first heard of it when I watched the popular Youtuber
            Jacksepticeye play it to completion.
            I was so moved that I bought the game and played it myself, and I still cried at the end! UNDERTALE is known
            for sparking a wave of content creation on the Internet, from animations, to music, to entire fan games
            dedicated to UNDERTALE itself. I
            learned the meaning of the word 'fandom' from my exposure to UNDERTALE.

          </h4>
          <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Another game that puts you in the shoes of a child, OMORI is a
            surreal horror adventure game that came out in December 2020. The title is a shortening of the Japanese word
            'Hikkikomori' - meaning 'hopeless shut-in'. Fittingly, you control a black-haired
            child named OMORI as he goes on adventures in a glitter-and-rainbows dreamland with his four colorful
            buddies - KEL, AUBREY, HERO, and BASIL. <br><br>However, things take a turn for the worse when OMORI...
            wakes up. The real world counterpart of
            OMORI - who you must give a name - has been a shut-in for a few years after a horrendous accident. What's
            more, in three days, his family will be moving somewhere else! A knock on the door reveals KEL, a lot older,
            and a lot taller. From him you
            learn that much has changed in the real world since the incident. There are festering feelings of anger,
            resentment, and guilt, all of which should not be left to grow. Will you have enough time to address broken
            friendships before they are broken
            forever?
            <br><br>OMORI is an unexpectedly dark and spooky adventure, steeped in the childlike drawing style its
            developer, OMOCAT, is so well-known for. Every piece of music, every dialogue option, and every haunting
            image pokes directly at the player's
            inner child, manipulating you into playing to the very end. The writing in this game is some of the best
            I've experienced.

          <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">It is the far future, and the human race is locked in a dire,
            bloody war. The IMC - a brutalist empire that controls the majority of colonized worlds - seeks to close its
            grip over those who remain free. Jack Cooper, a rifleman of the rebellion known
            as the Frontier Militia, is stranded on a planet when his commanding officer is killed before his eyes by
            hired guns. With his dying breaths, the officer gives Jack the right to pilot his Titan - an advanced mech
            built from the ground up for combat
            engagement - in order to complete a mission of utmost importance.<br><br>But what is the nature of this mission? Is Jack Cooper up to the challenge ahead, and is his Titan willing to help him along this path?<br><br>I bought this game on a whim one
            summer day, and I was blown away.
            Titanfall 2 is a combination FPS and mechwarrior wet dream, with a heavy seasoning of Bayformers
            over-the-top robot fistfights. Five years after its release, the game still has a following of dedicated
            players, who slay each other in a variety of
            fun competitive gamemodes. This game is unbelievably, improbably well made - from the thoughtful and decent
            campaign (with amazing level designs) to the perfectly implemented mobility system that has you feeling like
            a parkour master. Even the impactful
            thumping of the weapons - and the odd 'throok' noise when you get a headshot - fills me with adrenaline when
            I hop in. The game also contains a four-player PvE co-op gamemode, where you defend a base from waves of
            incoming IMC enemies. Give it a
            whirl! </p>

            surrounding the meltdown became an unpredictable and dangerous wasteland dotted with anomalies and mutants.
            Take one wrong step, and you'll be ripped apart, squished to death, electrocuted, or eaten. Welcome to the
            Zone, stalker. Count your bullets.<br><br> STALKER is a series of games that came out between 2001 and 2010.
            The only one I've played so far is Stalker:Anomaly - an up-to-date port of the last official game in the
            series, with many quality of life and customization systems modded in. Something about this game sets it
            apart from other shooters I've played - whether it's the oppresive, gloomy Russian landscapes, the abundance
            of real-world weapons with detailed historical information, or the emergent relationships between several
            factions, who are all vying for control of the Zone, Stalker made its impression on me quickly.<br><br>It's
            not everyone's cup of tea. There are so many ways to die, and it's expected that you quicksave liberally as
            you play. You must savor every resource, carefully repair your armor and guns to working order, and think
            hard about what quests to accept (and what quests to decline.) The best part of this game is the emergent
            gameplay - the chance of being ambushed by mutants, a scuffle with bandits, or randomly finding a backpack
            in a hollowed-out stump. All of this while you were just trying to do your job!</p>

The Horde is coming.<br><br> 7 Days to Die is a post-apocalyptic survival horror game that pits you against hunger, thirst, temperature, and zombies. Players must gather resources and build forts (using a building system not unlike Minecraft). The twist is that, every seventh night, a horde of zombies scours the earth and lays siege upon your fort. Every horde night that follows gets worse. You must see how far you can get without giving up!<br><br>The map the game takes place in is massive, and plans are underway for filling it with lore and miniature adventures. On top of this, the crafting system is involved and players can dig tunnels far into the ground. Most of all, the game is very fun with friends, as you put together a plan for survival and organize tasks accordingly. (It's also fun when you miscalculate and everybody dies on horde night!)</p>
