        <h2>I've learned some things over the years.</h2>
      </header>
      <p>It all started back in 2015 with the release of Undertale, my favorite video game ever. I felt awakened by
        the great story, the abstract gameplay, and the inspiring tale of one guy making a whole video game -
        including all of the music - with the help of his artist friends.&nbsp; I had to find people to talk to about
        it - and that led me to Discord. Little did I know that Discord was my gateway to many lasting friendships and
        real programming skills.
        From it I've learned LUA, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C#.</p>

            <h3>UNITALE</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The first programming language I learned was LUA, the main language of UNITALE, a Unity-based engine for
            making Undertale-themed battles. There I learned how to program waves, make objects wobble, rotate, and stab
            smoothly, and make loose attempts at storytelling.</p>

          </header>
          <p>This was my first gamejam project, created in a single weekend on the Unreal engine with two other people.
            Trick or Treat is your standard spooky game where a monster pursues you through darkened woods, as you
            collect pumpkins on the ground. </p>

          <p>Zoomstick is the second video game I've made with a team. In Zoomstick, you play as temple robber who finds
            an ancient shotgun capable of propelling the user high into the air. In this game, I wrote interpretive code
            used in loading/unloading levels.</p>

            <h3>All Ball</h3>
          </header>
          <p>All Ball is an irreverent and difficult physics-based platformer, made by me and one other partner as a
            final
            project for a class. The main takeaway from this project is that the entire physics engine was programmed by
            my
            partner and I, which was daunting but satisfying once it started to work!</p>

          <p>Okoro Ripples was the second game jam project I was a part of, for the Regnerate Game Jam. Inspired by Māori culture, Okoro Ripples is a peaceful fishing game that educates the player about Okoro, the fifth night of the Māori lunar calendar.</p>
